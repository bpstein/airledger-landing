              Our platform uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand and interpret contracts, orders and agreements. Staple's NLP process uses artificial intelligence to extract the key commitments made by all counterparties to a contract, order or agreement. <br/><br/>Staple's platform then ensures that the commitments of both counterparties are cryptographically sealed, logged and monitored for future performance.
